This dashboard provides a robust framework for strategic business management by combining sales analytics, customer experience metrics, and pandemic-driven trend monitoring.

Sales and Profitability Analysis: The dashboard segments product performance by main categories—ramen, chicken, and desserts—revealing not only the quantity sold but also granular revenue distribution across individual menu items. This allows management to identify top money-makers and underperformers, optimizing menu engineering by focusing marketing and inventory on bestselling dishes like Curry Ramen and Nashville Hot Chicken.

Operational Efficiency Tracking: By displaying the average wait time alongside review scores, the dashboard enables real-time monitoring of operational bottlenecks and their direct impact on customer satisfaction. Consistently high scores in both metrics signal effective front-of-house and kitchen workflows, informing operational best practices and staffing decisions.

Pandemic Response Evaluation: The clear inflection point at the pandemic’s onset creates a baseline for crisis response evaluation. Managers can assess how quickly operations rebounded relative to pre-pandemic levels and benchmark their adaptation speed and revenue resilience against broader market trends. The forward-looking revenue projection empowers proactive planning, helping leadership to adjust purchasing, staffing, and promotional strategies for sustained post-pandemic growth.

This viewpoint equips decision-makers to make proactive, data-driven adjustments, enhance operational effectiveness, and drive customer-focused growth even in volatile business environments.
